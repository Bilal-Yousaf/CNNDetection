## (1) Setup

### Install packages
- Install PyTorch ([pytorch.org](http://pytorch.org))
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Download model weights
- Run `bash weights/download_weights.sh`


## (2) Quick start
 
```
# Model weights need to be downloaded.
python demo.py examples/real.png weights/blur_jpg_prob0.1.pth
python demo.py examples/fake.png weights/blur_jpg_prob0.1.pth
```

`demo.py` simply runs the model on a single image, and outputs the uncalibrated prediction.

```
python demo_dir.py -d example_realfakedir -m weights/blur_jpg_prob0.5.pth
```

`demo_dir.py` runs the model on a directory


## (3) Dataset
The testset evaluated in the paper can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z_fD3UKgWQyOTZIBbYSaQ-hz4AzUrLC1/view?usp=sharing).

The zip file contains images from 13 CNN-based synthesis algorithms, including the 12 testsets from the paper and images downloaded from whichfaceisreal.com. Images from each algorithm are stored in a separate folder. In each category, real images are in the `0_real` folder, and synthetic images are in the `1_fake` folder. 

Note: ProGAN, StyleGAN, StyleGAN2, CycleGAN testset contains multiple classes, which are stored in separate subdirectories.

A script for downloading the testset is as follows:

```
# Download the dataset
cd dataset
bash download_testset.sh
cd ..
```

## (4) Evaluation

After the testset and the model weights are downloaded, one can evaluate the models by running:

```
# Run evaluation script. Model weights need to be downloaded.
python eval.py
```

Besides print-outs, the results will also be stored in a csv file in the `results` folder. Configurations such as the path of the dataset, model weight are in `eval_config.py`, and one can modify the evaluation by changing the configurations. The following are the models' performances on the released set:
